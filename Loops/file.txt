Yo, girl you touched me hard
your lomeliness has made me weep
I am a sooo stupid nerd
I thought about the words, I could not keep
So I weep
A stupid nerd

Yo girl, you are only eight
And a war made you burn inside
You were supposed to fly like a kite
But it made you fall, this nasty tide

The war took you away from the life
We have dreamt for the soft morning dew
Oh, little girl, I am burning with you
Inside and outside...
