In Python, functions or subroutines are extremely important for reusability of codes. We can call a function
for several times and pass many kind of arguments or parameters to get different effects.

<code>
def main():

    loops()
    loops()
    loops()
    #print("This is main function")

def loops():
    for i in range(6):
        print(i, " ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code>

The output is :

0
1
2
3
4
5
*************
0
1
2
3
4
5
*************
0
1
2
3
4
5
*************

Now let us try to understand why and how it happens. With "def" keyword we define a function name.
And the parenthesis () are meant to hold arguments or parameters in between them.
Now in def loops(6) function we have defined a function that is looping through from 0 to 5.
Now under main() function we have called that loops() function three times and you have seen the above
output.
