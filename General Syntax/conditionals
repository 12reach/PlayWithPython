In python there are two types of conditionals. Conditionals executions and conditionals values or expressions. In Conditional
executions we execute or check the condition of the statement. We know between two values there could be three
types of conditions.
It is either less than or greater than or it is equal.

<code>

#!/usr/bin/python3

a, b = 1, 8

if a < b:
    print("a is less than b.")
elif a > b:
    print("a is greater than b.")
else:
    print("a is equal to b.")

</code>

 The output is obvious. Now you can change the value and test the code.
 Now try to rewrite the above statement in a different way. We can say x is either less than y or greater than y.
 Else it is obviuos that they are equal.


<code>
x, y = 2, 8

statements = "x is less than y." if x < y else " x is not Less than y."

print(statements)
</code>
